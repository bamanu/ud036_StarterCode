# UD1: Movie Trailer website
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.
This source is completed with the code made from the Udacity course of Python and my own ideas to complete it.

## Prerequisites

You need Python installed in your pc. You can check it asking for your python version in de command line:

```
python -V
```

## Installing

No installation required. Just downlowd the code from the github respository:

```
git clone https://github.com/bamanu/ud036_StarterCode.git
```

## Usage
Execute the `entertainment_center.py` file.

Example of use:

```
git clone https://github.com/bamanu/ud036_StarterCode.git
cd ud036_StarterCode
entertainment_center.py
```

`entertainment_center.py` will create the html file if needed.
